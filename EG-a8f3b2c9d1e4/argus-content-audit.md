## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

The Argus page effectively combines:
- **Technical credibility** (how it works, architecture)
- **Business case** (market, pricing, projections)
- **Sales enablement** (comparison tables, ROI)
- **Community building** (free tools, engagement)

Other product pages focus heavily on technical capabilities and problem definition but lack the commercial depth needed for enterprise sales conversations. The Argus structure provides a complete template for creating investment-ready product presentations.
