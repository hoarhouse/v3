## KEY INSIGHTS FOR NEMESIS POSITIONING
--------------------------------------

### Verified Market Opportunity:
- €2-2.5 trillion total addressable market
- €5-29 billion annual fraud/corruption losses to target
- 250,000+ potential government buyers in EU
- 293,000 tenders annually needing monitoring

### Competitive Landscape:
- Most transparency platforms are FREE (OpenTender, Prozorro)
- Enterprise procurement platforms (SAP, Coupa) are expensive but not fraud-focused
- Gap exists for specialized, commercial fraud detection at mid-market pricing

### Regulatory Tailwinds:
- PPDS creating standardized data infrastructure (2025)
- NIS2 requiring supply chain security (2024-2025)
- Rising error rates (5.6%) creating urgency

### Pricing Strategy Implications:
- Must differentiate from free transparency tools
- Could position between free tools and enterprise platforms
- Consider tiered model: Free transparency tier, paid analytics/detection tiers
- Target mid-market governments that can't afford SAP/Coupa
