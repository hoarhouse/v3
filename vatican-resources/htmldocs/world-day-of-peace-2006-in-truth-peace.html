                    1 JANUARY 2006

                <h2 style="text-align: center;">IN TRUTH, PEACE</h2>
            </div>

            <!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
            <div class="htmldoc-section">
                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph">
                    <span class="paragraph-number">§1.</span> In this traditional Message for the World Day of Peace at the beginning of the New Year, I offer cordial greetings and good wishes to men and women everywhere, especially those who are suffering as a result of violence and armed conflicts. My greeting is one filled with hope for a more serene world, a world in which more and more individuals and communities are committed to the paths of justice and peace.
                </p>

                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph">
                    <span class="paragraph-number">§2.</span> Before all else, I wish to express my heartfelt gratitude to my Predecessors, the great Popes Paul VI and John Paul II, who were astute promoters of peace. Guided by the spirit of the Beatitudes, they discerned in the many historical events which marked their respective Pontificates the providential intervention of God, who never ceases to be concerned for the future of the human race. As tireless heralds of the Gospel, they constantly invited everyone to make God the starting-point of their efforts on behalf of concord and peace throughout the world. This, my first Message for the World Day of Peace, is meant to follow in the path of their noble teaching; with it, I wish to reiterate the steadfast resolve of the Holy See to continue serving the cause of peace. The very name Benedict, which I chose on the day of my election to the Chair of Peter, is a sign of my personal commitment to peace. In taking this name, I wanted to evoke both the Patron Saint of Europe, who inspired a civilization of peace on the whole continent, and Pope Benedict XV, who condemned the First World War as a "useless slaughter" and worked for a universal acknowledgment of the lofty demands of peace.
                </p>

                <h2>The Truth of Peace</h2>

                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph">
                    <span class="paragraph-number">§3.</span> The theme chosen for this year's reflection—In truth, peace—expresses the conviction that wherever and whenever men and women are enlightened by the splendour of truth, they naturally set out on the path of peace. The Pastoral Constitution Gaudium et Spes, promulgated forty years ago at the conclusion of the Second Vatican Council, stated that mankind will not succeed in "building a truly more human world for everyone, everywhere on earth, unless all people are renewed in spirit and converted to the truth of peace". But what do those words, "the truth of peace", really mean? To respond adequately to this question, we must realize that peace cannot be reduced to the simple absence of armed conflict, but needs to be understood as "the fruit of an order which has been planted in human society by its divine Founder", an order "which must be brought about by humanity in its thirst for ever more perfect justice". As the result of an order planned and willed by the love of God, peace has an intrinsic and invincible truth of its own, and corresponds "to an irrepressible yearning and hope dwelling within us".
                </p>

                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph">
                    <span class="paragraph-number">§4.</span> Seen in this way, peace appears as a heavenly gift and a divine grace which demands at every level the exercise of the highest responsibility: that of conforming human history—in truth, justice, freedom and love—to the divine order. Whenever there is a loss of fidelity to the transcendent order, and a loss of respect for that "grammar" of dialogue which is the universal moral law written on human hearts, whenever the integral development of the person and the protection of his fundamental rights are hindered or denied, whenever countless people are forced to endure intolerable injustices and inequalities, how can we hope that the good of peace will be realized? The essential elements which make up the truth of that good are missing. Saint Augustine described peace as tranquillitas ordinis, the tranquillity of order. By this, he meant a situation which ultimately enables the truth about man to be fully respected and realized.
                </p>

                <h2>The Lie and the Truth of Peace</h2>

                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph">
                    <span class="paragraph-number">§5.</span> Who and what, then, can prevent the coming of peace? Sacred Scripture, in its very first book, Genesis, points to the lie told at the very beginning of history by the animal with a forked tongue, whom the Evangelist John calls "the father of lies" (Jn 8:44). Lying is also one of the sins spoken of in the final chapter of the last book of the Bible, Revelation, which bars liars from the heavenly Jerusalem: "outside are... all who love falsehood" (22:15). Lying is linked to the tragedy of sin and its perverse consequences, which have had, and continue to have, devastating effects on the lives of individuals and nations. We need but think of the events of the past century, when aberrant ideological and political systems wilfully twisted the truth and brought about the exploitation and murder of an appalling number of men and women, wiping out entire families and communities. After experiences like these, how can we fail to be seriously concerned about lies in our own time, lies which are the framework for menacing scenarios of death in many parts of the world.

                <div class="htmldoc-key-teaching">
                    <h4>Key Teaching on Peace</h4>
                    <p>Peace is an irrepressible yearning present in the heart of each person, regardless of his or her particular cultural identity. Consequently, everyone should feel committed to service of this great good.</p>
                </div>

                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph">
                    <span class="paragraph-number">§6.</span> Peace is an irrepressible yearning present in the heart of each person, regardless of his or her particular cultural identity. Consequently, everyone should feel committed to service of this great good, and should strive to prevent any form of untruth from poisoning relationships. All people are members of one and the same family. An extreme exaltation of differences clashes with this fundamental truth. We need to regain an awareness that we share a common destiny which is ultimately transcendent, so as to maximize our historical and cultural differences, not in opposition to, but in cooperation with, people belonging to other cultures. These simple truths are what make peace possible; they are easily understood whenever we listen to our own hearts with pure intentions. Peace thus comes to be seen in a new light: not as the mere absence of war, but as a harmonious coexistence of individual citizens within a society governed by justice, one in which the good is also achieved, to the extent possible, for each of them.
                </p>

                <h2>International Humanitarian Law and the Truth of Peace</h2>

                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph">
                    <span class="paragraph-number">§7.</span> The truth of peace must also shed its light even when the mind of man seems clouded by the smoke of war. International humanitarian law needs to be considered as one of the finest and most effective expressions of the intrinsic demands of the truth of peace. Precisely for this reason, respect for that law must be considered binding on all peoples. Its value must be appreciated and its correct application ensured; it must also be brought up to date by precise norms applicable to the changing scenarios of today's armed conflicts and the use of ever newer and more sophisticated weapons.
                </p>

                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph">
                    <span class="paragraph-number">§8.</span> My grateful thoughts go to all those who have contributed by their initiatives and concrete actions to the formulation and application of international humanitarian law. Here I cannot fail to mention the many soldiers engaged in the delicate work of resolving conflicts and restoring the necessary conditions for peace. I wish to remind them of the words of the Second Vatican Council: "All those who enter the military service in loyalty to their country should look upon themselves as the custodians of the security and freedom of their fellow-countrymen; and where they carry out their duty properly, they are contributing to the maintenance of peace."
                </p>

                    <span class="paragraph-number">§9.</span> Nowadays, however, the truth of peace continues to be dramatically compromised and rejected by terrorism, whose criminal threats and attacks leave the world in a state of fear and insecurity. These are often the fruit of a tragic and disturbing nihilism which Pope John Paul II described in these words: "Those who kill by acts of terrorism actually despair of humanity, of life, of the future. In their view, everything is to be hated and destroyed." Not only nihilism, but also religious fanaticism, today often called fundamentalism, can inspire and encourage terrorist thinking and activity. From the beginning, Pope John Paul II was aware of the explosive danger represented by fanatical fundamentalism, and he condemned it unsparingly, while warning against attempts to impose, rather than to propose for others' free acceptance, one's own convictions about the truth.

                    <h4>Warning on Nihilism and Fundamentalism</h4>
                    <p>Nihilism and fundamentalism share an erroneous relationship to truth: the nihilist denies the very existence of truth, while the fundamentalist claims to be able to impose it by force.</p>

                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph">
                    <span class="paragraph-number">§10.</span> Careful consideration of these factors shows clearly that nihilism and fundamentalism share an erroneous relationship to truth: the nihilists deny the very existence of truth, while the fundamentalists claim to be able to impose it by force. Despite their different origins and cultural backgrounds, both show a dangerous contempt for human beings and human life, and ultimately for God himself. Indeed, this shared tragic outcome results from a distortion of the full truth about God: nihilism denies God's existence and his provident presence in history, while fanatical fundamentalism disfigures the loving and merciful countenance of God, replacing him with idols made in its own image. In analysing the causes of the contemporary phenomenon of terrorism, consideration should be given to its deeper cultural, religious and ideological motivations.

                <h2>The Church's Call for Peace</h2>

                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph">
                    <span class="paragraph-number">§11.</span> Faced with the risks which humanity is facing in our time, all Catholics in every part of the world have a duty to proclaim and embody ever more fully the "Gospel of peace", and to show that acknowledgment of the full truth of God is the first, indispensable condition for consolidating the truth of peace. God is Love which saves, a loving Father who wants to see his children look upon one another as brothers and sisters, working responsibly to place their various talents at the service of the common good of the human family. God is the unfailing source of the hope which gives meaning to personal and community life. God, and God alone, brings to fulfilment every work of good and of peace. History has amply demonstrated that declaring war on God in order to eradicate him from human hearts only leads humanity, fearful and impoverished, towards decisions which are ultimately futile.

                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph">
                    <span class="paragraph-number">§12.</span> In reflecting on the theme "in truth, peace", we need to realize, first of all, that the truth of peace has "won the day" on several fronts. We note with satisfaction the decline in the number of armed conflicts. While fully aware of the tragedy and suffering still being caused by warfare and terrorism, we should also acknowledge the undeniable advances in difficult peace-building efforts, both at the level of politics and of economic relations. I am thinking here in the first place of the significant progress made towards the consolidation of peace and stability in some areas once troubled by war and destruction. Among the positive developments in recent years we should also mention the increased role played in the peace process by the United Nations Organization and by various regional organizations, as well as by numerous governmental and non-governmental organizations.

                <h2>Nuclear Weapons and the Truth of Peace</h2>

                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph">
                    <span class="paragraph-number">§13.</span> Yet all of this cannot lead us to be overly optimistic. We cannot forget that, tragically, violent fratricidal conflicts and devastating wars still continue to sow tears and death in vast parts of the world. There are situations where conflict, hidden like flame beneath ashes, can flare up anew and cause immense destruction. Those in authority who, instead of making every effort to promote peace, incite their citizens to hostility towards other nations, bear a heavy burden of responsibility: in particularly delicate areas they risk setting off a spiral of violence which they may no longer be able to control. Here special mention should be made of the nuclear threat and the prospect of the catastrophic destruction which it entails. Recent worrying developments once more demonstrate how precarious and deceptive is a peace based merely on the threat of mutual destruction. The conclusion of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons should be confirmed by concrete commitments to proceed with disarmament, and ultimately, to the complete dismantling of nuclear arsenals.

                <div class="htmldoc-key-teaching">
                    <h4>On Nuclear Disarmament</h4>
                    <p>"What can be said, too, about those governments which count on nuclear arms as a means of ensuring the security of their countries? Along with countless persons of good will, one can state that this point of view is not only baneful but also completely fallacious. In a nuclear war there would be no victors, only victims."</p>
                </div>

                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph">
                    <span class="paragraph-number">§14.</span> Progress towards the dismantling of arms and definitive disarmament can only be achieved by care on the part of all to ensure the good of humanity as a whole. To those who are tempted to face the great problems of humanity with methods and means contrary to the truth of man, the Church says clearly and firmly: "Peace is not just the absence of war. It cannot be reduced solely to maintaining a balance of power between adversaries nor does it arise out of despotic domination." She repeats what Pope Paul VI said at the conclusion of the Council: "Peace must be born of mutual trust between nations rather than imposed on them through fear of weapons." May efforts be made to reach peaceful resolutions of conflicts on the basis of the force of law and justice!
                </p>

                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph">
                    <span class="paragraph-number">§15.</span> The truth of peace calls for all—individuals and peoples—to enrich their lives through the values of generosity, solidarity, and love; it calls for every person to place the common good above private interest. It therefore invites us to take a clear stand for truth and against lies and manipulation. The truth of peace requires that all—whether governments, international organizations or civil society—be more transparently accountable for their actions. For the good of humanity, the organizations which represent the United Nations need to be more effective in their service to the legitimate aspirations of the peoples they represent. The attainment of peace depends above all on recognizing that we are, in God, one human family.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                <p class="htmldoc-paragraph">
                    <span class="paragraph-number">§16.</span> At the conclusion of this Message, I would like to address a particular word to all believers in Christ, inviting them once again to be attentive and generous disciples of the Lord. When we hear the Gospel, dear brothers and sisters, we learn to build peace on the truth of a daily life inspired by the commandment of love. It is necessary that each community undertake an extensive and incisive education for peace aimed especially at the young, so as to teach them how to live in harmony and peace with others, not in conflict and violence. Moreover, I ask families to draw fresh enthusiasm and strength from the Eucharist, and thus to become capable of facing, with the grace of God, the wearisome difficulties of daily life. To all I offer my encouragement, asking the Lord to grant each person's commitment to peace to be authentic and fruitful.

                    Confident that Mary, Mother of the Prince of Peace, will respond to our prayers with maternal solicitude, I express to all my sentiments of sincere esteem and I invoke upon the world the abundance of God's mercy and blessings of harmony, prosperity and peace.
